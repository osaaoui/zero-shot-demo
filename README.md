# zero-shot-demo
Zero shot classification demo using HuggingFace open-source models.

The labels/classes come from my graduation project (repository Banking Model) predictors used to classify Banking Complaints.

I used 2 models: 
1. the "MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli": https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli
2. "facebook/bart-large-mnli": https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli


Please refer to the HuggingFace docs for more information on using the 2 models
