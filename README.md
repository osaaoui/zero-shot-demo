# zero-shot-demo
Zero shot classification demo using HuggingFace open-source models.
The labels/classes come from my graduation project (repository Banking Model) predictors used to classify Banking Complaints.
I used 2 models: 
1. the "MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli"
2. "facebook/bart-large-mnli"
